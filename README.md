This design is actually not particularly bad, however there are a few things that I dislike about this.  First The taped over panel on
the top looks bad, if I had taped over it, I would have made it, so it looks like nothing is there, because this is just not
aesthetically pleasing.  Secondly there are 3, possibly four buttons, or button looking pieces to this display, that may 
confuse people in an emergency.  First there is a light just below the tapped over panel, that looks just like a button however it is 
not, 
they could make the lights look different from the buttons, so people donâ€™t press it.  Secondly the alarm button and the help button
could be confusing, if I were designing this I would make the alarm button be labeled emergency, and the same layout as the help
button, and the help button I would label with maybe a wheelchair or something that says this is for someone with special needs, 
because someone could press that for help in an emergency, instead off the emergency button.  Finally, the emergency phone is not well 
labeled, there is a light at the button that indicated if the phone has been answered, however the cover is not labeled with phone in 
any way, so its hard to tell where it is.  Next I would make the ground floor button either in line with the rest of the buttons, or 
larger, to either make all of the buttons consistently in line or to distinguish the ground button from the rest, as the ground floor
is the most likely to be pressed.  On the accessibility front, I would make the brail on the buttons more robust because as it is it 
looks like they are wearing down which may make it hard to read.  Final issue with this elevator is that the buttons were not very 
good; the lights were not very bright.  They were also not very easy to press, me having to give it a decent amount of force

1.	Think about the common things that you use an elevator. List your most common uses and other rarer uses. Does the interface make doing those common things easier?
The obvious most common use is going floor to floor using the elevator; from that going to the ground floor is probably the most likely
scenario because people always need to get to the ground floor of the structure.  There is also using the open and close door buttons
would be a very common use case.  Some of the rarer functions would be using the help button for help for people with disabilities.
Finally, and hopefully the rarest use case would be pressing the alarm button. 

2.	Think about how the user interacts with the elevator. What is the common sequence of actions?
Someone presses a button to get the elevator to come to them. Then they get on and press their floor and go down to their floor.  Along
the way people may get on and off the elevator, and they may need to use the open or close door buttons at some point along the way.

3.	How does the elevator support the user figure out how to make it work?
I believe that it follows a pretty standard layout, making it so while I do have issues with it as a whole, I think that it is actually
not the worst I have encountered, just the worst I could find.


4.	How does the elevator provide feedback to the user?
Yes, it illuminates the buttons that are pressed, and there is a light that says which direction you are moving.


5.	What are some common mistakes you can make with this current design?
Because the buttons are stiff if you do not make sure that your floor is selected you could miss your floor.  Also in the case of an
emergency, I believe that you should have an emergency button, not just an alarm bell; while also with the help I would put a handicap
sign so people know that it is not thought to be an emergency button.


6.	Suggest the improvements to make on the control interface. Sketch your solution. And justify your design decisions.
I Would make the lobby button larger than the rest of the other buttons, I would also label the emergency button emergency so that it is 
more clear which to press in an emergency, overall I will largely follow the design pattern used in the elevator I took a picture of.
